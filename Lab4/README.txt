Project name: lab4
Date: 9 / 18 / 2022
Purpose: Lab4 takes our knowledge from the previous two labs (lab2_2 and lab3) and teaches us how to combine
	 the two parts (LEX and YACC) and allow them to work as one functioning program. We expanded on the 
	 context free grammer in the YACC file to extend the functionality of our calculator to recognize variable
 	 names also, rather than just recognizing single lower case character values.
